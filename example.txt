Once upon a time there was a programmer. But he didn't ever use git! After all,
he was a good programmer and didn't need to. 

But one day, he made a mistake and wrote buggy code. He searched for hours for
his bug, but couldn't figure it out.

He fell to the hell where the world is filled with fire and sword! Until he 
decides to seek salvation from git, he will live there in hell miserably ever after!

One day the demon said to the programmer, would you like to sign a treaty with me
 and get some bugless code?
